## Project Description 
```
A web app based around the theme of job security. Our app focuses on allowing members to build a profile that includes their skillsets and contact information. They can then take a quiz to filter through jobs recommended to them based on their skillset. They can also take a quiz on what their current skills are and their current job and they will be recommended different courses they can take to upgrade their skills. Users can check off when they have completed the courses and get a badge on their profile.
